      <p>A good morning routine can drastically change your life. We know some of you are not morning people in general but unfortunately, much of society revolves around them so it will not hurt to have a routine of your own to make sure you are on top of things. Here are a few things to keep in mind while formulating your morning routine so that you can become your most successful self.</p>
      <h2>Eliminate as many decisions as possible beforehand</h2>
      <p>Your morning routine should actually begin the night before. You can do this by eliminating every decision that you will need to make in the morning. From what you want to wear tomorrow to school/work to ironing them to keeping all the products you will need to use ready and even sorting out breakfast. </p>
      <h2>Learn to wake up on time</h2>

      <p>By not waking up on time you are giving in to your temptations and opening the doors to regret thereby setting the wrong tone for the rest of your day. So, no matter how difficult it is, try and wake up on time every single day (with the exception of sick days of course).</p>
      <h2>Make your be every morning</h2>
      <p>We know this is not the first time you are hearing this. However, making the bed is all the rage because this little task is so much more than meets the eye. We should always begin the day on a positive note and making the bed does exactly that. It gives you a sense of accomplishment which you can build on throughout the day. </p>
      <h2>Hydrate</h2>
      <p>Rehydrating yourself immediately after waking up can do wonders for you. Remember you go six to eight hours without any water when you are sleeping so more than anything else, you will need at least a glass or two of water after getting up. It raises your level of alertness, helps with bowel movements and metabolism, generates more oxygen in your blood, fuels the brain, strengthens the immune system, gets rid of toxins, the list just goes on and on. </p>
      <h2>Activate the mind and the body</h2>
      <p>A light workout after waking up is exactly what you need. It activates the mind and the body. How? Well for starters, it starts the day in a very energetic way promoting focus, optimism, and much like making the bed, a sense of accomplishment. Your mind gets all perked up. It also gets blood pumping so you are more likely to stay active throughout the day and eat in a timely manner, go to bed in a timely manner, and just be on top of everything.</p>
      <h2>Skim through your goals and objectives for the day</h2>
      <p>Adding to the first point, it can be a good idea to list down your goals and objectives of the day in a notebook or the 'notes' feature of your phone and skim through them after waking up. It will create a structure for the rest of your day and you can work with that.</p>
